                <p>This website took me about 30 minutes to make. I did not use a CSS background-image because I
                    do not like them and do not think they are used that often in the current trend of UX/UI design. 
                    The images are either my own or able to used with their respective watermarks. The code for this website is
                    available <a href="https://github.com/sebastian-ch/andy" target="_blank">here.</a>
